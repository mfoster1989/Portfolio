                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>Hailing from Seattle, Washington, by way of Montana, DC, and New York City, I settled in Denver to get some sun.  I am a big Seahawks fan, and have seen them play not only in Seattle, but also Denver, Kansas City, New York, Nashville, Dallas, and the Mecca of football, Green Bay.</p>
